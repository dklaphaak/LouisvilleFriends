Where to put this?... "Quakers practice Simplicity which is a belief in moderation of possessions to maintain our focus of living in the moment and not becoming attached to worldly things. There is a strong commitment to nonviolence (Peace) and reconciliation that addresses the misuse and abuse of power. Friends strive to demonstrate Integrity which is genuineness in speech and conduct and leaves no room for deceit or artificiality. Community is a unifying bond that is created by shared worship.  We value the ideas and gifts that each member brings to the meeting.""

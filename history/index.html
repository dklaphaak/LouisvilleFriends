        <h3>History of the Louisville Friend's Meeting</h3>
        <br>
<blockquote>Then you will come to walk cheerfully over the world, answering that of God in everyone;<br>
whereby in them you may be a blessing, and make the witness of God in them to bless you.
        <br>
George Fox (1624 - 1691)</blockquote>

<p>
In 1937, a small group of Friends began holding Sunday afternoon worship meetings in Louisville, KY. In 1954 Joan and Lee Thomas moved to Louisville and insisted on a full-time meeting for the proper development of the membership. Regular First Day (Sunday) morning meetings for worship at the old Neighborhood House on 1st. Street, Monthly Meeting with Attention to Business, study groups and First-Day school were established.</p>
<p>
  In 1962 Louisville Friend's Meeting became a full-fledged Monthly Meeting and a member of the Quarterly Meeting. And, in 1964 a house at 3050 Bon Air Ave., formely part of the Roederer farm, was purchashed as a meeetinghouse. Built before the Civil War, it was made of bricks from the Farmington estate kiln, with Amercan chestnut joists and hand-wrought, square headed nails. The Meeting repaired and expanded it under the supervision of Mansir Tydings, an architech and community activist. It is still the home of the Meeting.

</p>

<p>Members of the Louisville Friends Meeting have been active in our community ever since. In the mid-fifties, the Meeting joined the newly formed Kentucky Council on Human Relations. Several members were involved in the efforts to integrate the restaurants and stores in Louisville at the time. Other members were Interns in Industry at the Plymouth Community Center, student volunteers at Central State Hospital, and volunteers for the adult education program known as Learn More -- Earn More. </p>

<p>In 1959, the Meeting sponsored an Hungarian refugee family following the failed revolution in Hungary. During the Vietnam War, the Meeting joined with other local organizations to form the Kentuckiana Military and Draft Counseling Center, which counseled young men who were considering conscientious objections to the War and the draft.</p>

<p>Other efforts in recent years have included the formations of the Louisville Friends School, the Student-Parent Aid &amp; Resource Center for children with learning and discipline issues, the Peace Education Program, and Ploughshares, which developed housing for low-income families. </p>

<p>The Meeting continues to sponsor and mentor refugee families supported by the Kentucky Refugee Ministries and participate in local peace and justice efforts such as the local chapters of the United Nations Association and the Fellowship Of Reconciliation.</p>

<p>Quakers practice <b>Simplicity</b> which is a belief in moderation of possessions to maintain our focus of living in the moment and not becoming attached to worldly things. There is a strong commitment to nonviolence (<b>Peace</b>) and reconciliation that addresses the misuse and abuse of power. Friends strive to demonstrate <b>Integrity</b> which is genuineness in speech and conduct and leaves no room for deceit or artificiality. <b>Community</b> is a unifying bond that is created by shared worship.  We value the ideas and gifts that each member brings to the meeting. </p>
